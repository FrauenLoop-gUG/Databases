# Week1 Class1 #

## Outline ##

6:00 p.m. - 6:15 p.m. everyone is arriving, and people are meeting for the first time. 

6:15 p.m. - ~6:30 p.m. - introductions of all of the mentors with each mentor giving a quick background about themselves to break the ice.

6:30 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. - Start introducing data modeling in a structured way. Introduce data tables as a way to store data as in the idea of excel. Start with the example of an address book. Have students create an address book table which they can fill out. There is a natural extension here for phone numbers which is a great segue for the next section.

7:00 p.m. - 7:30 p.m. - Start introducing the idea of multiple tables which have relationships between them. This time with the addition of different books that they own as a second table. This also introduces the idea of dimension tables through the 'genre' of a book. The objective here is to be able to, entirely on paper, set up a dataset which will be used for a book swap.

7:30 p.m. - 7:45 p.m. - Break time

7:45 p.m. - 8:15 p.m. - Introduce the exercise: divide up into small teams to set up a dataset, again, entirely on paper, where they set up a library. So, they have people that have books which they are willing to lend and people who have books that they want to borrow. They should set up the data model necessary to do that. The goal is to have a fully fledged data model which lets them do everything. Stretch goal: add the tables necessary to persist things like 'lost' and 'damaged' books, as well as introducing the concept of 'late fines'.

8:15 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. - Break out for work on the assignment in smaller groups, we can walk around and see if they have any questions.


I was inspired for this by: [http://webs.wofford.edu/whisnantdm/Courses/CS101/PDF/Database/Relational_database_concepts.pdf]()
and
[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bknauff/dwebd/2004-02/DB-intro.pdf]()

## What was completed ##

1. Concept of a database

2. Relational tables and how to tie them together

3. Database design, 1:1 vs. 1:N data relationships

4. Multiple table product development (the building out of a lending library)

5. Students designed their database and tables on paper. 

I think that what is next is to actually get the students experience with building these tables out into software. This will involve installing and running a SQL GUI and creating the library systems that they described in this class. Hopefully next class we can bring up the following concepts:

1. Field "types" - i.e. classifying fields into the types of data that they store --> int, string, date, etc.

2. "create table" statements

3. "insert into" statements
