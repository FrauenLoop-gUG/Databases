## Primary Resources: ##

Maybe use the attached PowerPoint in two sessions, to introduce data & databases?
  - slides look good to me, though some stuff we can pass over as it is too abstract/in depth

## Side Notes: ##
I wonder whether this is enough for the first week. I think it might also be possible to introduce SQL already in this week - maybe only the basic select statement - ie

otherwise taught in week 2

Then if we use the OTS tutorial already, we could get the setup (described here: [http://opentechschool.github.io/sql-tutorial/chapter1.html]()) done already, and allow the students to start playing with the newly installed software and imported dataset.
