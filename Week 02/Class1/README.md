## Content Covered: ##

* Quick Quiz at the start of class
* Review CREATE, INSERT, DELETE, SELECT statements and get people up to speed.
* Present WHERE clauses with multiple criteria 
* Present LEFT JOIN of tables
* Present aliasing of a table
* Give students the chance to work on the above by creating their own tables.

* LEFT JOIN seems to be a concept that people are struggling with. More attention needs to be paid to it. 
* NON '=' where statements (<,>,like,!=, etc) need to be covered.
